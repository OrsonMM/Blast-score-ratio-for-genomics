# Find_Island_genes

These script find genes in draft assembly genomes and return a Matrix.csv with Blast score ratio for each gene in your multifasta

Usage:


        python like_bsr.py dir_DraftGenomes Multifasta_for_DB
        
  
dir_DraftGenomes = Directory with your draft genomes or complete genomes



Multifasta_for_DB = A file multifasta with genes of your interest. 



Example multifasta:

>gen1
ctagctagcta
>gen2
ctgctag
>gen3
